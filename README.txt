Program Desciption:

Fibonacci Part 1:
The purpose of this part of the lab is to compare the two methods we discussed in class for programs about Fibonacci
which are using recursion and using dynamic programming. As the numbers get larger, the recursive program takes increasingly longer
amounts of time to run when compared to the dynamic programming method. 

Fibonacci Part 2: 
In part 2, I implemented the exact same process as in lab 1 to run the executable file using python subprocesses instead. Then, I outputted 
a statement about the results of running the c++ code. 


How to run code:

Fibonacci Part 1:
For recursive:
$ g++ 7755662598fibonacci_recursive.cpp -o ./recursive.out
$ ./recursive.out 13

For dynamic programming:
$ g++ 7755662598fibonacci_dp.cpp -o ./dp.out
$ ./dp.out 13


Fibonacci Part 2: 
$ python3 7755662598fibonacci.py

Notes: 
For Fibonacci part 2, I used some background knowledge from my TAC class I took to help with the input stuff.
